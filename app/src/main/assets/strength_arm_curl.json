  "heading": "TARGETED MUSCLES: Upper arm muscles. WHAT YOU NEED: Hand-held weights or household items (soup cans, bottles of water). TIP: As you progress, use a heavier weight and alternate arms until you can lift the weight comfortably with both arms. After a few weeks of doing this exercise for your upper arm muscles, lifting that gallon of milk will be much easier.",
  "steps": {
    "1": "Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.",
    "2": "Hold weights straight down at your sides, palms facing forward. Breathe in slowly.",
    "3": "Breathe out as you slowly bend your elbows and lift weights toward chest. Keep elbows at your sides.",
    "4": "Hold the position for 1 second.",
    "5": "Breathe in as you slowly lower your arms.",
    "6": "Repeat 10-15 times.",
    "7": "Rest; then repeat 10-15 more times."
